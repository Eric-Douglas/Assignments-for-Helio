PURPOSE FOR APP: an idea right now, I want to build an application that holds DnD character information. Each user (email) can store their characters (multiple) into the database. These characters will be assigned to each user via id so as to differentiate whose character is whose. Character information may comprise: char name, gender, age, race, class, AC, total HP, inventory (weapons, armour, etc), campaign, and alignment. Each user should have the option to update their characters whenever needed as during DnD updates to the char sheet are a norm, but only when logged in and only to their own characters. The DM should have access to ALL data in the system, including users and their characters. Here are some data groups in the app:

CAMPAIGNS {
users,
permissions
}

USERS {
login info
}

CHARACTER {
char attributes,
items,
spells,
user id
}

ITEMS {
attributes,
description,
stats
} 

SPELLS {
attributes,
description,
stats
}

1. Nexus.js (MAIN PAGE)
