-What is a User Interface? an inerface is what the user directly interacts with and affects. Essentially, it is the part of the app that the user "uses."
-Explain the different between the User Experience and the User Interface. User experience is something done in testing, or rather, something that is tested more specifically. It entails how the user feels about the interface by seeing how ergonomic and easy to use the program is. The interface determines a huge part of the user's experience.
-What is a Mock Up? A mockup is a draft of a program/product. It is meant to simulate the purpose and feel of the product.
-Define Low & High Fidelity: Low fidelity is done through wireframing, handdrawn work, or pcitures. It is often left open for the designers to use their imagination, and serves as a light structure for a project whereas high fidelity in a lot of cases generally leans towards being more code heavy. In some cases, some hi-fi prototypes can be mistaken for the actual product because of their complexity and how well fleshed out it is.
-Outline the benefits of using one: Low fidelity prototyping is low cost and quick. Almost anyone can do it, even people who are not particularly gifted in art. It's a convenient way to envision a product without some of the difficulties and time consuming processes required to make a hi-fi prototype.
-What is Mobile First Design? Mobile first design is the idea that an app or program should be first designed to fit a mobile device sufficiently well enough. From there, the prodcuct can be expanded on a computer, as apps for the computer are generally more powerful, complex, and able to hold more features. Assuming one can make a highly effective app for mobile devices, the same program would work well on a computer too.
-Who should be in control of the User Interface? The user should be in control of the interface.
-Define Reusable Components: Self contained components that can be reused. They often manage their own state.
