1. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion of a process or asyncronous operation,
regardless of the outcome (rejection or resolve)

2. We use promises to attach callback functions, but also because they help with structure and organization.
Promises are very specific, and can be used syncronous and asyncronously. It allows us to control timing of our
code as well.

3. Because we can use promises to write asyncronous code as if it were syncronous, it gives us a better
control over our code. It allows us to be specific with what we do and how data is structured as well as
how the code handles outcomes. It can make finding failures easier.
