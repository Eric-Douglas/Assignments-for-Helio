-What is a Database? A database is system in which information is stored and organized. It is a collection
stored in the backend server.

-Why is a Database necessary? Because files can get so large, and so interconnected with a massive network of
other files (to make everything work), there needs to be a place for proper storage of the aforementioned files.
Databases make organization easier too, and can make finding a particular file/folder more possible when buried in
a sea of files.

-What can be stored in a Database? All sorts of things can be stored in a database. If it is digital information,
there's a good chance it can be stored in one. This includes IDs, objects, strings, numbers, personal information
and passwords just to name a few.

-What types of Databases are there? There are four types of databases. These are text, desktop, relational, and noSQL
databases. Each serve a different role.

-Why would I use one over the other? Certain database types work differently and have certain features.
A lot has to do with preference of user.

-What is a Query? A query is a search, usually in the form of a string.

-What is Encryption? Encryption is a form of file protection. The code is deceptive in that it is unreadable.
However, there are two types of encryption. One allows encryption to be reversed whereas the other is one-sided.
There is also salt and peppering to add extra protection (some symbols are uncrackable at the front and back of a line)

-Why is it important at the Database level? Simple; if there is no encryption on a database, outsiders can breach and
acquire access to whatever they please on the database for whatever purposes. These purposes are almost always maligned. 

-What is Object Permanence? Object permanence is where an object exists regardless of how visible it is. 

-Where can your Database live? A database can live in a backend server or even on a single computer.
