    <p class="box2"> <u> About Me Personally </u> <br> 
      My name is Eric Douglas. I'm a 21 year old software developer. I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, but I currently 
        live in Bluffdale, Utah. I like learning languages and am currently learning both Russian and Finnish. 
        I enjoy reading and writing as well, and I'm in the process of writing a novel right now. I play video games too, and have amassed 
        quite the collection though I don't play as much as I used to. I really enjoy listening to music as 
        well.
        I also enjoy movies and shooting firearms, particularly sniper rifles since my father introduced me to long distance shooting 
        when I was young.

    <p class="box2"><u> My Aspirations </u> <br> 
      Aside from hobbies, I find computers interesting. I have some huge goals in life and I hope that programming and
        web design can help me accomplish those. Of these goals, the most important to me is my plan to move to Finland to 
        start a future and be with my girlfriend. I want to contribute to the technological world by working with computers 
        and various softwares. I think there is certainly a need for more programmers to support our rapid technological 
        growth in science and society, and so I'm excited to contribute to this exciting field.
